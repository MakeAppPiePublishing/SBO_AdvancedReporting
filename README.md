# SAP Business One Advanced Reporting: Routing Slips
SAP Business One 9.3 added Routing to the Bill of Materials and Production Orders but did not include a report for routing. In this course, you'll learn some advanced reporting features in SQL and Crystal Reports to make that report. 

The course is broken into these five videos:
* **Introducing Routing:** You'll learn how to use routing in the Bill Of Materials and production orders, create your own routing steps and organzie your BoM to contain the materials for each step.
* **SQL for Routing:** You'll learn which tables to use for routing, how to link them properly, and the one bug with using `JOIN` for routing. 
* **SQL Subqueries:** You'll learn how to get around the bug from the previous video by using subqueries for routing. 
* **Crystal Reports Subreports:** You'll learn how in Crystal Reports to make a subreport for the line items in a production order with and without routing. 
* **Crystal Reports Returning Values in Subreports:** You'll make a subreport that returns the number of routing stages to the main report, which hides and shows the correct line items at runtime, and learn the limitations of doing so. 

You'll find here the exercise files for these videos including the completed template for a Crystal Reports routing slip. 

**Note:** On the Crystal Reports files, be sure to update the database to your own database before using. 

This minicourse is an extension of my LinkedInLearning course [SAP Business One Reporting And Customization](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/sap-business-one-reporting-and-customization). I assume you know that material for this minicourse. If you don't or are a bit rusty on Crystal reports of SQL in SAP B1, please check it out and help me get a nice fat royalty check so I can afford to do other minicourses like this.
